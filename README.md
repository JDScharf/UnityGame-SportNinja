# UnityGame-SportNinja
Game can be played at: https://connect.unity.com/p/sport-ninja
Use your Mouse or track pad to click sports balls that are shooting up on the screen.  Not at all related to to that other ninja game ;)  Left click destroys objects.  Sports balls have a point value of between 5-15 points and skulls have a -10 value.  There is also three different difficulty modes.  I made this game in Unity's Create With Code course using prefab objects made by Synty Labs.  Thanks for checking it out!  ~Jason
